    "message": "Talkie was developed a few days before the New Year 2016/2017, on a challenge from a friend. The challenge started with the question: while commuting to work, is it possible to listen to an article instead of reading it? Easy, I said, and set out to prove it - or at least to make my browser speak out text using a silly computer voice. The basic version, without any user interface, turned out to be trivial to create. Adding a user interface, took a bit longer. Adding proper language detection a bunch more code. Overcoming bugs in the browser even more work. The list of improvements and features goes on - and a few thousand lines of code later, you're looking at the end result."
